config CRC_CCITT
	tristate "CRC-CCITT functions"
	help
	  This option is provided for the case where no in-kernel-tree
	  modules require CRC-CCITT functions, but a module built outside
	  the kernel tree does. Such modules that use library CRC-CCITT
	  functions require M here.

config CRC16
	tristate "CRC16 functions"
	help
	  This option is provided for the case where no in-kernel-tree
	  modules require CRC16 functions, but a module built outside
	  the kernel tree does. Such modules that use library CRC16
	  functions require M here.

config CRC64
	tristate "CRC64 functions"
	help
	  This option is provided for the case where no in-kernel-tree
	  modules require CRC64 functions, but a module built outside
	  the kernel tree does. Such modules that use library CRC64
	  functions require M here.

config CRC4
	tristate "CRC4 functions"
	help
	  This option is provided for the case where no in-kernel-tree
	  modules require CRC4 functions, but a module built outside
	  the kernel tree does. Such modules that use library CRC4
	  functions require M here.

config CRC7
	tristate "CRC7 functions"
	help
	  This option is provided for the case where no in-kernel-tree
	  modules require CRC7 functions, but a module built outside
	  the kernel tree does. Such modules that use library CRC7
	  functions require M here.

config CRC8
	tristate "CRC8 function"
	help
	  This option provides CRC8 function. Drivers may select this
	  when they need to do cyclic redundancy check according CRC8
	  algorithm. Module will be called crc8.
