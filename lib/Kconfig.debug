config CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT
	int "Default console loglevel (1-15)"
	range 1 15
	default "7"
	help
	  Default loglevel to determine what will be printed on the console.

	  Setting a default here is equivalent to passing in loglevel=<x> in
	  the kernel bootargs. loglevel=<x> continues to override whatever
	  value is specified here as well.

	  Note: This does not affect the log level of un-prefixed printk()
	  usage in the kernel. That is controlled by the MESSAGE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT
	  option.

config CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_QUIET
	int "quiet console loglevel (1-15)"
	range 1 15
	default "4"
	help
	  loglevel to use when "quiet" is passed on the kernel commandline.

	  When "quiet" is passed on the kernel commandline this loglevel
	  will be used as the loglevel. IOW passing "quiet" will be the
	  equivalent of passing "loglevel=<CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_QUIET>"

config MESSAGE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT
	int "Default message log level (1-7)"
	range 1 7
	default "4"
	help
	  Default log level for printk statements with no specified priority.

	  This was hard-coded to KERN_WARNING since at least 2.6.10 but folks
	  that are auditing their logs closely may want to set it to a lower
	  priority.

	  Note: This does not affect what message level gets printed on the console
	  by default. To change that, use loglevel=<x> in the kernel bootargs,
	  or pick a different CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT configuration value.

config DEBUG_KERNEL
	bool "Kernel debugging"
	help
	  Say Y here if you are developing drivers or trying to debug and
	  identify kernel problems.

menu "Compile-time checks and compiler options"

config DEBUG_INFO
	bool "Compile the kernel with debug info"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && !COMPILE_TEST
	help
          If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will include
	  debugging info resulting in a larger kernel image.
	  This adds debug symbols to the kernel and modules (gcc -g), and
	  is needed if you intend to use kernel crashdump or binary object
	  tools like crash, kgdb, LKCD, gdb, etc on the kernel.
	  Say Y here only if you plan to debug the kernel.

	  If unsure, say N.

config DEBUG_INFO_REDUCED
	bool "Reduce debugging information"
	depends on DEBUG_INFO
	help
	  If you say Y here gcc is instructed to generate less debugging
	  information for structure types. This means that tools that
	  need full debugging information (like kgdb or systemtap) won't
	  be happy. But if you merely need debugging information to
	  resolve line numbers there is no loss. Advantage is that
	  build directory object sizes shrink dramatically over a full
	  DEBUG_INFO build and compile times are reduced too.
	  Only works with newer gcc versions.

config DEBUG_INFO_SPLIT
	bool "Produce split debuginfo in .dwo files"
	depends on DEBUG_INFO
	help
	  Generate debug info into separate .dwo files. This significantly
	  reduces the build directory size for builds with DEBUG_INFO,
	  because it stores the information only once on disk in .dwo
	  files instead of multiple times in object files and executables.
	  In addition the debug information is also compressed.

	  Requires recent gcc (4.7+) and recent gdb/binutils.
	  Any tool that packages or reads debug information would need
	  to know about the .dwo files and include them.
	  Incompatible with older versions of ccache.

config DEBUG_INFO_DWARF4
	bool "Generate dwarf4 debuginfo"
	depends on DEBUG_INFO
	help
	  Generate dwarf4 debug info. This requires recent versions
	  of gcc and gdb. It makes the debug information larger.
	  But it significantly improves the success of resolving
	  variables in gdb on optimized code.

config GDB_SCRIPTS
	bool "Provide GDB scripts for kernel debugging"
	depends on DEBUG_INFO
	help
	  This creates the required links to GDB helper scripts in the
	  build directory. If you load vmlinux into gdb, the helper
	  scripts will be automatically imported by gdb as well, and
	  additional functions are available to analyze a Linux kernel
	  instance. See Documentation/dev-tools/gdb-kernel-debugging.rst
	  for further details.

config ENABLE_MUST_CHECK
	bool "Enable __must_check logic"
	default y
	help
	  Enable the __must_check logic in the kernel build.  Disable this to
	  suppress the "warning: ignoring return value of 'foo', declared with
	  attribute warn_unused_result" messages.

config FRAME_WARN
	int "Warn for stack frames larger than (needs gcc 4.4)"
	range 0 8192
	default 3072 if KASAN_EXTRA
	default 2048 if GCC_PLUGIN_LATENT_ENTROPY
	default 1280 if (!64BIT && PARISC)
	default 1024 if (!64BIT && !PARISC)
	default 2048 if 64BIT
	help
	  Tell gcc to warn at build time for stack frames larger than this.
	  Setting this too low will cause a lot of warnings.
	  Setting it to 0 disables the warning.
	  Requires gcc 4.4

config STRIP_ASM_SYMS
	bool "Strip assembler-generated symbols during link"
	default n
	help
	  Strip internal assembler-generated symbols during a link (symbols
	  that look like '.Lxxx') so they don't pollute the output of
	  get_wchan() and suchlike.

config READABLE_ASM
        bool "Generate readable assembler code"
        depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
        help
          Disable some compiler optimizations that tend to generate human unreadable
          assembler output. This may make the kernel slightly slower, but it helps
          to keep kernel developers who have to stare a lot at assembler listings
          sane.

config HEADERS_CHECK
	bool "Run 'make headers_check' when building vmlinux"
	help
	  This option will extract the user-visible kernel headers whenever
	  building the kernel, and will run basic sanity checks on them to
	  ensure that exported files do not attempt to include files which
	  were not exported, etc.

	  If you're making modifications to header files which are
	  relevant for userspace, say 'Y', and check the headers
	  exported to $(INSTALL_HDR_PATH) (usually 'usr/include' in
	  your build tree), to make sure they're suitable.

config DEBUG_SECTION_MISMATCH
	bool "Enable full Section mismatch analysis"
	help
	  The section mismatch analysis checks if there are illegal
	  references from one section to another section.
	  During linktime or runtime, some sections are dropped;
	  any use of code/data previously in these sections would
	  most likely result in an oops.
	  In the code, functions and variables are annotated with
	  __init,, etc. (see the full list in include/linux/init.h),
	  which results in the code/data being placed in specific sections.
	  The section mismatch analysis is always performed after a full
	  kernel build, and enabling this option causes the following
	  additional steps to occur:
	  - Add the option -fno-inline-functions-called-once to gcc commands.
	    When inlining a function annotated with __init in a non-init
	    function, we would lose the section information and thus
	    the analysis would not catch the illegal reference.
	    This option tells gcc to inline less (but it does result in
	    a larger kernel).
	  - Run the section mismatch analysis for each module/built-in.a file.
	    When we run the section mismatch analysis on vmlinux.o, we
	    lose valuable information about where the mismatch was
	    introduced.
	    Running the analysis for each module/built-in.a file
	    tells where the mismatch happens much closer to the
	    source. The drawback is that the same mismatch is
	    reported at least twice.
	  - Enable verbose reporting from modpost in order to help resolve
	    the section mismatches that are reported.

config ARCH_WANT_FRAME_POINTERS
	bool

config FRAME_POINTER
	bool "Compile the kernel with frame pointers"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && ARCH_WANT_FRAME_POINTERS
	default y if DEBUG_INFO || ARCH_WANT_FRAME_POINTERS
	help
	  If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will be slightly
	  larger and slower, but it gives very useful debugging information
	  in case of kernel bugs. (precise oopses/stacktraces/warnings)

config STACK_VALIDATION
	bool "Compile-time stack metadata validation"
	depends on HAVE_STACK_VALIDATION
	default n
	help
	  Add compile-time checks to validate stack metadata, including frame
	  pointers (if CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER is enabled).  This helps ensure
	  that runtime stack traces are more reliable.

	  This is also a prerequisite for generation of ORC unwind data, which
	  is needed for CONFIG_UNWINDER_ORC.

	  For more information, see
	  tools/objtool/Documentation/stack-validation.txt.

config DEBUG_FORCE_WEAK_PER_CPU
	bool "Force weak per-cpu definitions"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  s390 and alpha require percpu variables in modules to be
	  defined weak to work around addressing range issue which
	  puts the following two restrictions on percpu variable
	  definitions.

	  1. percpu symbols must be unique whether static or not
	  2. percpu variables can't be defined inside a function

	  To ensure that generic code follows the above rules, this
	  option forces all percpu variables to be defined as weak.
