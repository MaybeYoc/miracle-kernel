 * This is percpu allocator which can handle both static and dynamic
 * areas.  Percpu areas are allocated in chunks.  Each chunk is
 * consisted of boot-time determined number of units and the first
 * chunk is used for static percpu variables in the kernel image
 * (special boot time alloc/init handling necessary as these areas
 * need to be brought up before allocation services are running).
 * Unit grows as necessary and all units grow or shrink in unison.
 * When a chunk is filled up, another chunk is allocated.
 *
 *  c0                           c1                         c2
 *  -------------------          -------------------        ------------
 * | u0 | u1 | u2 | u3 |        | u0 | u1 | u2 | u3 |      | u0 | u1 | u
 *  -------------------  ......  -------------------  ....  ------------
 *
 * Allocation is done in offset-size areas of single unit space.  Ie,
 * an area of 512 bytes at 6k in c1 occupies 512 bytes at 6k of c1:u0,
 * c1:u1, c1:u2 and c1:u3.  On UMA, units corresponds directly to
 * cpus.  On NUMA, the mapping can be non-linear and even sparse.
 * Percpu access can be done by configuring percpu base registers
 * according to cpu to unit mapping and pcpu_unit_size.
 *
 * There are usually many small percpu allocations many of them being
 * as small as 4 bytes.  The allocator organizes chunks into lists
 * according to free size and tries to allocate from the fullest one.
 * Each chunk keeps the maximum contiguous area size hint which is
 * guaranteed to be equal to or larger than the maximum contiguous
 * area in the chunk.  This helps the allocator not to iterate the
 * chunk maps unnecessarily.
 *
 * Allocation state in each chunk is kept using an array of integers
 * on chunk->map.  A positive value in the map represents a free
 * region and negative allocated.  Allocation inside a chunk is done
 * by scanning this map sequentially and serving the first matching
 * entry.  This is mostly copied from the percpu_modalloc() allocator.
 * Chunks can be determined from the address using the index field
 * in the page struct. The index field contains a pointer to the chunk.
 *
 * To use this allocator, arch code should do the followings.
 *
 * - define __addr_to_pcpu_ptr() and __pcpu_ptr_to_addr() to translate
 *   regular address to percpu pointer and back if they need to be
 *   different from the default
 *
 * - use pcpu_setup_first_chunk() during percpu area initialization to
 *   setup the first chunk containing the kernel static percpu area

/*
 * Generic SMP percpu area setup.
 *
 * The embedding helper is used because its behavior closely resembles
 * the original non-dynamic generic percpu area setup.  This is
 * important because many archs have addressing restrictions and might
 * fail if the percpu area is located far away from the previous
 * location.  As an added bonus, in non-NUMA cases, embedding is
 * generally a good idea TLB-wise because percpu area can piggy back
 * on the physical linear memory mapping which uses large page
 * mappings on applicable archs.
