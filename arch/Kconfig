config JUMP_LABEL
       bool "Optimize very unlikely/likely branches"
       depends on HAVE_ARCH_JUMP_LABEL
       depends on CC_HAS_ASM_GOTO
       help
         This option enables a transparent branch optimization that
	 makes certain almost-always-true or almost-always-false branch
	 conditions even cheaper to execute within the kernel.

	 Certain performance-sensitive kernel code, such as trace points,
	 scheduler functionality, networking code and KVM have such
	 branches and include support for this optimization technique.

         If it is detected that the compiler has support for "asm goto",
	 the kernel will compile such branches with just a nop
	 instruction. When the condition flag is toggled to true, the
	 nop will be converted to a jump instruction to execute the
	 conditional block of instructions.

	 This technique lowers overhead and stress on the branch prediction
	 of the processor and generally makes the kernel faster. The update
	 of the condition is slower, but those are always very rare.

	 ( On 32-bit x86, the necessary options added to the compiler
	   flags may increase the size of the kernel slightly. )

config STATIC_KEYS_SELFTEST
	bool "Static key selftest"
	depends on JUMP_LABEL
	help
	  Boot time self-test of the branch patching code.

config HAVE_ARCH_JUMP_LABEL
	bool

config HAVE_ARCH_JUMP_LABEL_RELATIVE
	bool

config HAVE_STACKPROTECTOR
	bool
	help
	  An arch should select this symbol if:
	  - it has implemented a stack canary (e.g. __stack_chk_guard)

config CC_HAS_STACKPROTECTOR_NONE
	def_bool $(cc-option,-fno-stack-protector)

config STACKPROTECTOR
	bool "Stack Protector buffer overflow detection"
	depends on HAVE_STACKPROTECTOR
	depends on $(cc-option,-fstack-protector)
	default y
	help
	  This option turns on the "stack-protector" GCC feature. This
	  feature puts, at the beginning of functions, a canary value on
	  the stack just before the return address, and validates
	  the value just before actually returning.  Stack based buffer
	  overflows (that need to overwrite this return address) now also
	  overwrite the canary, which gets detected and the attack is then
	  neutralized via a kernel panic.

	  Functions will have the stack-protector canary logic added if they
	  have an 8-byte or larger character array on the stack.

	  This feature requires gcc version 4.2 or above, or a distribution
	  gcc with the feature backported ("-fstack-protector").

	  On an x86 "defconfig" build, this feature adds canary checks to
	  about 3% of all kernel functions, which increases kernel code size
	  by about 0.3%.

config STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG
	bool "Strong Stack Protector"
	depends on STACKPROTECTOR
	depends on $(cc-option,-fstack-protector-strong)
	default y
	help
	  Functions will have the stack-protector canary logic added in any
	  of the following conditions:

	  - local variable's address used as part of the right hand side of an
	    assignment or function argument
	  - local variable is an array (or union containing an array),
	    regardless of array type or length
	  - uses register local variables

	  This feature requires gcc version 4.9 or above, or a distribution
	  gcc with the feature backported ("-fstack-protector-strong").

	  On an x86 "defconfig" build, this feature adds canary checks to
	  about 20% of all kernel functions, which increases the kernel code
	  size by about 2%.

config HAVE_ARCH_WITHIN_STACK_FRAMES
	bool
	help
	  An architecture should select this if it can walk the kernel stack
	  frames to determine if an object is part of either the arguments
	  or local variables (i.e. that it excludes saved return addresses,
	  and similar) by implementing an inline arch_within_stack_frames(),
	  which is used by CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY.

config ARCH_MMAP_RND_BITS_MIN
	int

config ARCH_MMAP_RND_BITS_MAX
	int

config HAVE_STACK_VALIDATION
	bool
	help
	  Architecture supports the 'objtool check' host tool command, which
	  performs compile-time stack metadata validation.

config HAVE_RELIABLE_STACKTRACE
	bool
	help
	  Architecture has a save_stack_trace_tsk_reliable() function which
	  only returns a stack trace if it can guarantee the trace is reliable.

config HAVE_ARCH_COMPILER_H
	bool
	help
	  An architecture can select this if it provides an
	  asm/compiler.h header that should be included after
	  linux/compiler-*.h in order to override macro definitions that those
	  headers generally provide.

config ARCH_USE_BUILTIN_BSWAP
       bool
       help
	 Modern versions of GCC (since 4.4) have builtin functions
	 for handling byte-swapping. Using these, instead of the old
	 inline assembler that the architecture code provides in the
	 __arch_bswapXX() macros, allows the compiler to see what's
	 happening and offers more opportunity for optimisation. In
	 particular, the compiler will be able to combine the byteswap
	 with a nearby load or store and use load-and-swap or
	 store-and-swap instructions if the architecture has them. It
	 should almost *never* result in code which is worse than the
	 hand-coded assembler in <asm/swab.h>.  But just in case it
	 does, the use of the builtins is optional.

	 Any architecture with load-and-swap or store-and-swap
	 instructions should set this. And it shouldn't hurt to set it
	 on architectures that don't have such instructions.
