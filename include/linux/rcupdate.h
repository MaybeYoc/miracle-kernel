/**

 * @p: pointer to assign to
 * @v: value to assign (publish)
 *
 * Assigns the specified value to the specified RCU-protected
 * pointer, ensuring that any concurrent RCU readers will see
 * any prior initialization.
 *
 * Inserts memory barriers on architectures that require them
 * (which is most of them), and also prevents the compiler from
 * reordering the code that initializes the structure after the pointer
 * assignment.  More importantly, this call documents which pointers
 * will be dereferenced by RCU read-side code.
 *
 * In some special cases, you may use RCU_INIT_POINTER() instead
 * of rcu_assign_pointer().  RCU_INIT_POINTER() is a bit faster due
 * to the fact that it does not constrain either the CPU or the compiler.
 * That said, using RCU_INIT_POINTER() when you should have used
 * rcu_assign_pointer() is a very bad thing that results in
 * impossible-to-diagnose memory corruption.  So please be careful.
 * See the RCU_INIT_POINTER() comment header for details.
 *
 * Note that rcu_assign_pointer() evaluates each of its arguments only
 * once, appearances notwithstanding.  One of the "extra" evaluations
 * is in typeof() and the other visible only to sparse (__CHECKER__),
 * neither of which actually execute the argument.  As with most cpp
 * macros, this execute-arguments-only-once property is important, so
 * please be careful when making changes to rcu_assign_pointer() and the
 * other macros that it invokes.
