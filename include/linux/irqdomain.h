 * irq_domain - IRQ translation domains
 *
 * Translation infrastructure between hw and linux irq numbers.  This is
 * helpful for interrupt controllers to implement mapping between hardware
 * irq numbers and the Linux irq number space.
 *
 * irq_domains also have hooks for translating device tree or other
 * firmware interrupt representations into a hardware irq number that
 * can be mapped back to a Linux irq number without any extra platform
 * support code.
 *
 * Interrupt controller "domain" data structure. This could be defined as a
 * irq domain controller. That is, it handles the mapping between hardware
 * and virtual interrupt numbers for a given interrupt domain. The domain
 * structure is generally created by the PIC code for a given PIC instance
 * (though a domain can cover more than one PIC if they have a flat number
 * model). It's the domain callbacks that are responsible for setting the
 * irq_chip on a given irq_desc after it's been mapped.
 *
 * The host code and data structures use a fwnode_handle pointer to
 * identify the domain. In some cases, and in order to preserve source
 * code compatibility, this fwnode pointer is "upgraded" to a DT
 * device_node. For those firmware infrastructures that do not provide
 * a unique identifier for an interrupt controller, the irq_domain
 * code offers a fwnode allocator.
